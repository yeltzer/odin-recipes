    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb</li>
      <li>1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li>
      <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven).
        Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks,
        use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until
        softened, about 5 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and
        cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat
        or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4
        teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce
        to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it
        cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the
        seasoning accordingly
      </li>
      <li>
        About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of
        salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package
        directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested
        cooking time
      </li>
      <li>
        Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the
        cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some
        of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top
      </li>
    </ol>
