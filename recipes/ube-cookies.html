      <a href="./spaghetti.html">spaghetti</a>, you might want a little treat to
      end off the meal. These ube cookies are perfect for that, they have a
      unique sugar cookie taste and are easy to make!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup glutinous rice flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 large whole egg</li>
      <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
      <li>8 tbsp ube puree or ube halaya jam</li>
      <li>1 tsp ube extract</li>
      <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small mixing bowl add all dry ingredients (flours, baking powder,
        salt) and whisk to combine. Set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        In a larger mixing bowl for wet ingredients, combine the butter,
        granulated sugar, and brown sugar until fully incorporated
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the eggs into the wet ingredient bowl. Then, add the ube puree and
        ube extract. Combine until the dough mixture color is homogenous
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly add dry ingredients into the wet ingredients while mixing until
        incorporated
      </li>
      <li>Chill the bowl of dough in the freezer for about 20 minutes</li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set
        aside
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove dough from the freezer and scoop about 1 tablespoon of dough and
        roll into a ball
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the ball of dough in a bowl of powdered sugar until it's well
        coated-I roll it around until it's completely white on the outside.
        Place dough on a baking sheet and give one-inch space between each
        cookie
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the cookies are firm. Remove from the
        oven and place the cookies on a cooling rack for five minutes. Serve and
        enjoy
