      This chicken milanese is quick and easy to make while still being rich in
      flavor. This dish can be combined with our pasta recipe or eaten on it's
      own.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 skinleess, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F</li>
      <li>
        Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Spread flour in
        another dish and bread crumbs in a third dish
      </li>
      <li>
        Working with one piece at a time, gently press chicken into flour to
        coat and shake off any excess. Dip into beaten eggs, then press into
        bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so excess bread crumbs can
        fall away. Place breaded chicken onto a plate while breading the rest;
        do not stack
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken
        in batches of 2 or 3 pieces until golden brown and no longer pink in the
        center, 2 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted
        into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        Transfer cooked chicken to a baking sheet and keep warm in the preheated
        oven while cooking remaining chicken
      </li>
      <li>Serve with lemon wedges</li>
    </ol>
